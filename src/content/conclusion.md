## Closing Thoughts
In the past, record labels decided the songs that people heard via radio stations and physical media. Nowadays, artists can share their music easily with the world without needing a record label, thanks to the rise of music streaming platforms like Spotify and social media like TikTok, YouTube, and more. This project looked at how social media metrics and metadata can help predict which songs are most likely to be added to playlists. It is useful to know if a song will be added to a playlist, because songs on a playlist will stay popular and gain streams over time.

The modeling section of this project showed that social media metrics can be used to predict a song's playlist likelihood. Some of the most important metrics for this were Shazam counts, release numbers, an artist's followers, and the days since release of the song.

This project found patterns between social media and streaming data. For example, songs that were not explicit, had a low impact on TikTok, but had a high YouTube view-to-like ratio were linked with high numbers of Spotify streams. These patterns help explain how different social media platforms and metrics can affect a song's popularity on streaming platforms.

Another part of this project (PCA and clustering) grouped songs based on common features. Songs in certain clusters had better chances of being added to playlists. By looking at the features of the most playlist worthy song groups, artists and music platforms can learn what the features are of songs that are doing well. Knowing this can help with decisions about song promotion.

As a bonus, this project tested if it was possible to predict a song’s genre using its lyrics. This is useful because during the playlist likelihood model building, genre tags were often missing or incorrect in datasets. The lyrics to genre models worked well, showing that lyrics are enough to make a decent guess at the genre of a song. These models could help with organizing music and improving future classiciation models.

In conclusion, this project shows that social media and metadata can help predict which songs are most likely to be added to playlists. The results of this project can help artists, music platforms, and companies make better decisions about music promotion.
